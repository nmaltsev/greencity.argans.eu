                <p>According to a 2022 World Health Organisation report almost the entire global population breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants. Since 2000, the levels of these pollutants in cities has risen significantly.</p>
                <p>More than half of the world's population lives in cities and many of these cities share the problem of poor air quality. By 2050, 70% of the world's population will reside in urban areas, and outdoor air pollution will lead to about 6.6 million premature deaths and widespread loss of healthy years of life. Air pollution is the leading environmental health risk factor globally. The pollutants of major public health concern include fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulphur dioxide. </p>
                <p class="lead my-3">Death and ill health attributable to air pollution is now estimated to be on a par with other major global health risks. Lowering air pollution levels can reduce the incidence of disease from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases. [WHO 2021]</p>
                <p class="mb-3">Air quality is closely linked to the earth's climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing air pollution levels can contribute to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change.</p>

                <p>In 2015, the World Health Assembly adopted a landmark resolution on air quality, recognising it as one of the leading avoidable cause of death and ill health. Member states pledged to tackle the problem.</p>
                <p>The European Environment Agency 2021 Zero Action Plan sets the target to reduce the number of premature deaths due to exposure to fine particulate matter by 55% by 2030, as compared to 2005. [EEP 2021]</p>
                <p>The European regulations for air quality (e.g., Air Quality Directive 2008/50/EC) and other environmental policies (e.g., EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030; EU Pollinators Initiative) commit territories and cities of at least 20,000 inhabitants to publish their Carbon Footprint every three years, a Territorial Climate Air and Energy Plan every five years and to develop an Urban Greening Plan.</p>

                <p class="lead">Not every tree species is suitable for urban planting. Air pollution removal by trees strongly depends on the location, tree species, and structural characteristics of individual trees, such as tree height, leaf area index, and crown diameter.</p>
                <p>To date, urban trees' air pollution removal capacity have been investigated in a few cities through municipal tree inventories,  mainly based on field observations and mapped in Geographical Information Systems. Some, like the  i-Tree ECO model (US Department of Agriculture), include cloud sourcing components and air quality metrics but usually these inventories include only trees managed by the municipality, which can represent as low as 20-30% of the total number of urban trees.</p>
                <p>The main limiting factor for studying individual trees is the high cost and spatial resolution of techniques, such as aerial photography and airborne laser scanning.</p>

                <p>Mistakes have been made, some municipalities have hurriedly planted wrong tree species, and these planting strategies have degraded air quality and increased asthma exacerbation.

                <p>This was the sobering conclusion of an ARGANS Case Study of two European cities. On the other hand, by selecting efficient plant species and developing an ambitious urban greening strategy,  ARGANS could provide a detailed estimate of improvements to meet the city's air quality standards.</p>
                <p>For instance, each newly reforested area (based on 400 trees) will remove annually at least 3.0 tons of O3, 2.5t NO2, 1.5t PM10, 0.8t PM2.5, 10t CO2, and lead to an ambient air two °C cooler compared to the surrounding area and increased carbon stocks (2t per ha).</p>
                <p>With the above air pollution reduction, two premature deaths and ten hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases could be "avoided" annually. Each newly reforested area could prevent damages valued at €173,000 per year due to the quantity of O3, NO2, PM and CO2 removed. The newly reforested area can also markedly improve citizens' quality of life by providing a space to meet others, play sports and participate in an active, healthy lifestyle.</p>
