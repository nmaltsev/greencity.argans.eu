                <p>By 2050, 70% of the world's population will reside urban areas, and outdoor air pollution would lead to about 6.6 million premature deaths. To date, millions of people are exposed to concentrations above the limit values for the human health protection for fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, and tropospheric ozone with significant rising levels in cities since 2000s.</p>

            <p>The successive heat waves and air pollution peaks occurred since 2000s, and COVID-19 pandemic, allowed a considerable awareness of public authorities, and have opened the door to planting strategies (greening and re-naturing cities) to mitigate the air pollution and climate change effects, enhance biodiversity, and provide recreational areas. Under the European Green Deal, the European Union commits to plant at least 3 billion additional trees in Europe by 2030.</p>

            <p>Urban reforestation, e.g., by increasing the tree density in cities, and peri-urban reforestation near densely populated cities where it is not easy to plant trees, can help improve air quality and meet clean air standards in cities. The vegetation facilitates deposition of particles and gases on leaves, trunk, and branches, and absorbs gaseous air pollutants through their stomata. However, some municipalities have hurriedly planted any tree species (e.g., isoprene emitters), and these planting strategies have degraded air quality and increased asthma exacerbation.</p>
            <p>Air pollution removal by trees strongly depends on the location, tree species, and structural characteristic of individual trees such as tree height, leaf area index, and crown diameter. To date, the air pollution removal capacity by urban trees were investigated only in a few cities by using the i-Tree Eco model (US Department of Agriculture) and municipal tree inventories. Municipalities only report their Carbon footprint through the municipal inventory of public trees</p>
            <p>However, the municipal tree inventories, mainly based on field observations and mapped in a Geographical Information Systems, include only trees managed by the municipality which represent e.g., about 20-30% of the total number of trees. The high cost and spatial resolution of techniques, such as aerial photography and airborne laser scanning, are the main limiting factor allowing the study of individual trees.</p>
            <p>To set up an ambitious greening plan, adapted to real needs, city planners need a suitable selection of plant species as well as a realistic tree inventory (public and private) to properly assess the role of urban green spaces in mitigating air pollution and the climate change effects in and around the cities</p>

            <h4>Satellite-derived city-wide green spaces inventory</h4>
            <p>ARGANS acquires commercial Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images, which have a spatial resolution of less than 50cm, that enables us to detect and identify individual <strong>public and private</strong> urban trees and to classify them accordingly e.g., counting, species, height, crown diameter etc</p>
            <p>Satellite remote sensing allows us to do this for the entire city and prepare an accurate chart of green spaces within the city and a detailed inventory of the public and private individual trees, shrubs and grass</p>
            <p class="mb-5">This service is billed at € 2,500 excluding tax + € 50 per square kilometer of area analyzed.</p>
            <h4>Quantifying the effects of green Spaces on air quality</h4>
            <p>Knowledge of species and characteristics of the urban greenery allows us to estimate the environmental benefits of the urban tree heritage in measurable units at the scale of the entire city.</p>
            <p>We provide quantified estimates of carbon storage, carbon dioxide sequestration, and air pollutant removal capacity in units of tons of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particles per year</p>
            <p>To quantify the benefits, we provide charts of Urban Heat Islands for the entire city and an estimate of thermal comfort (Universal Thermal Comfort Index).</p>
            <p class="mb-5">This service is billed at € 5,000 excluding tax + € 50 per square kilometer of area analyzed.</p>
            <h4>Recommendations for clean air and greening plans</h4>
            <p>Depending on your territory and environmental conditions, ARGANS provides a list of suitable species to plant for healthier air in city, open areas available, and best practices recommendations for regreening cities (e.g., choice of plant species, number). Each tree species is assessed for its resistance to local conditions (e.g., drought tolerance, pests, and diseases), biological characteristics, and capacity to absorb air pollutants. Training of authorities in the development of Urban Greening Plans and monitoring of execution</p>
            <p class="mb-5">This service costs from € 2,500 excluding tax</p>
            <h4>Assessment of health and economic benefits</h4>
            <p>To fully appreciate the benefits of an Urban Greening Plan, ARGANS quantifies the socio-economic benefits derived from planting programs in each area: reduction in premature deaths and hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses and the related costs.</p>

            <p><strong>The development of ambitious urban greening strategies, by selecting efficient plant species, can help meeting air quality standards in city.</strong> The new reforested area (based on 400 trees) will remove annually at least 3.0 tons O3, 2.5t NO2, 1.5t PM10, 0.8t PM2.5, 10t CO2, ambient air 2°C cooler compared to surrounding area and increase carbon stocks (2t per ha). With the above air pollution reduction, 2 premature deaths and 10 hospital admissions for respiratory and cardio-vascular diseases could be “avoided” annually. Each new reforested area could prevent damages valued at <strong>€173,000 per year</strong> due to the quantity of O3, NO2, PM and CO2 removed. The new reforested area can also markedly improve quality of life of citizens by providing an area to meet others, to play sports and part of an active healthy lifestyle.</p>
